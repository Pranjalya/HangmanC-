# HangmanC-
It's the game of hangman with codes written in c++. I'd advise using Turbo C++ for this project.
It's a basic game of Hangman, where the person has to guess the name of the movie. Points are awarded according to the number of guesses taken and the difficulty level. You can store your marks in the data file, edit it, delete it, modify it and view it.
